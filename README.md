Welcome to √ñstg√∂ta Event! A modern event ticketing platform for √ñsterg√∂tland County, built with Blazor WebAssembly and .NET 9. This application enables users to discover, search, and purchase tickets for local events while providing administrators with powerful management tools.
This is a sideproject created by Viktor Th√∂rn, Joakim Bjerselius and Jesper Wallentin. The events on this application is fabricated and while inspiration has been taken from existing events, the application has no connection to any real events nor proper functionality in real world ticket sales.

## üåü Features

### For Users
- **Event Discovery**: Browse, search, and sort events by date, name, city, size or amount of tickets left.
- **Secure Authentication**: BCrypt-powered user registration and login
- **Ticket Management**: View purchased tickets easily while logged in
- **Profile Management**: Update contact information and password
- **Responsive Design**: Seamless experience across all devices

### For Administrators
- **Comprehensive Dashboard**: Manage events, users, and tickets
- **CRUD Operations**: Full control over system entities
- **Search Functionality**: Quick access to specific records by ID
- **Secure Access**: Role-based authorization system connected to backend-services

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The solution follows a hybrid approach combining Vertical Slice and Onion Architecture principles, organized into four main projects:

- **BlazorStandAlone**: Frontend WASM application built with reusable components
- **Api**: Backend REST API with controller endpoints
- **Core**: Central business logic and data models
- **Test**: Backend service testing using Reqnroll xUnit

### Key Technical Aspects
- **Frontend**: Blazor WebAssembly with component-based architecture
- **Backend**: .NET 9 API with controller endpoints
- **Database**: SQLite with Entity Framework Core
- **Authentication**: Custom authentication with BCrypt password hashing
- **Authorization**: Session-based with role verification connected to backend
- **Validation**: 
  - Frontend: DataAnnotations
  - Backend: FluentValidation
